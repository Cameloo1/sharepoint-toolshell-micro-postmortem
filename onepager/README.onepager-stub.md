# One-Pager Export Stub (Do Not Build Yet)

This repository intentionally excludes a PDF deliverable. When ready to create the one-page executive summary:

1. Use the main `README.md` as the authoritative content source. Summarize the Scope, ATT&CK snapshot, hunts, comms cadence, and decision guidance.
2. Incorporate the generated figures (`figures/attack-mini.png`, `figures/decision-tree.png`) or their vector equivalents.
3. Confirm any IOC or hunt details align with organization policy before distribution.
4. Export to PDF with your preferred tooling (e.g., Markdown → PDF via `pandoc`, presentation software, or docs platform workflows).
5. Version the PDF outside this build (e.g., `onepager/` subfolder) and note the export date/time alongside any reviewer approvals.

> Reminder: LinkedIn/social media content is explicitly out of scope for this build. Document leadership approvals separately if you later publish summaries.*** End Patch
